      <description>Are All Programming Languages Equal?After programming with R for about a semester, I found it exponentially difficult to do exploratory data analysis in Python - a language I’ve been using for years now.

Also, there’s piping - I’m not sure who thought of that, but its my favorite programming tool I’ve learned so far!</description>
