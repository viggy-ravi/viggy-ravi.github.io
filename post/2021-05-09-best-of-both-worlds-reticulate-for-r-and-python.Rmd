## Are All Programming Languages Equal?

After programming with R for about a semester, I found it exponentially difficult to do exploratory data analysis in Python - a language I've been using for years now. R is a great programming language to perform many statistical tests; moreover, the simplicity of `tidyverse` makes it so easy to do exploratory data analysis. Also, there's *piping* - I'm not sure who thought of that, but its my favorite programming tool I've learned so far!

That being said, there are a lot of Python packages - especially the machine learning packages - that I enjoy using and am familiar with. Luckily for me, I don't have to choose between the two programming languages anymore.

## What is `reticulate`

`Reticulate` is an R package that allows you to interface to Python modules, classes, and functions. So now you can expertly analyze your data and maximize the benefits of two languages.

## How to use Python in RStudio

For this example, I will be performing a t-test to see if the weights of male and female mosquitoes are statistically different. In the process, we will learn how to define variables in both the R and Python chunks, and see how to interface variables between the two scopes. *Note, the weights of mosquitoes are log-normal, meaning their weights are normally distributed if transformed with the natural log.*

```{python}
# Untransformed data of mosquito weights (female, male)
f = [0.291, 0.208, 0.241, 0.437, 0.228, 0.256, 0.208, 0.234, 0.320]
m = [0.185, 0.222, 0.149, 0.187, 0.191, 0.219, 0.132, 0.144, 0.140]

# print pair of two weights
print("female","male")
for pair in zip(f,m):
  print(pair)

```
However, these weights are log-normal. We can use `NumPy` to take the log of the mosquito weights.

```{python}
import numpy as np

# find the log weights
f_log = np.log(f)
m_log = np.log(m)
```

R is most well known for its statistical packages, so lets make use of them! First, we'll import the library `reticulate`, which can help us interface Python variables with R functions. Then we will be able to use Python-defined variables using the `py$` prefix in the R chunk.

```{r}
library(reticulate)

# perform a t-test in R
p_value <- t.test(py$f_log, py$m_log)$p.value
```

Now, lets see what the p-value is. We can access R-defined variables by using the `r.` prefix. 

```{python}
print(round(r.p_value,4))
```
Great! We see that the p-value of the log-normal mosquito weights is less than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis and state that the mean weights of male and female mosquitoes are different. 

## Conclusion

Programming languages are tools. As smart problem-solvers, we can now have more tools at our disposal to analyze data with ease! Happy coding.
